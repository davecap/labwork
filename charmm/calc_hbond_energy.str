!COOR HBONd command (corman.doc) finds and lists all hydrogen bonds between two atom-selections based on r(H-A), and optionally âˆ§(D-H-A).

!coor hbond sele type hn end sele type O end coor hbond sele segid prot end sele segid wat end verb

!!! For each donor/acceptor in the first selection the number of hydrogen bonds to any acceptor/donor in the second selection is printed out.
!!! Keyword VERBose gives a more detailed listing that includes the identity of the atoms involved in the second selection, and the actual geometry.
!!! CHARMM substitution variables ?NHBOND and ?AVNOHB are set if VERBose is not used.
